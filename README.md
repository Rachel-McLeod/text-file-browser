# text-file-browser
PyQt / SQL database browser for test documents, including many-to-many tags

Once a database is opened, the application allows easy browsing of text stored in a .sqlite database. Results can be filtered with a search string in the title field or text body, and with  tags. A dialog also allows new text files to be added, including adding tags in arbitrary categories.

While using QSqlQueryModel would have been less work, I wanted to look at SQL in more detail.
